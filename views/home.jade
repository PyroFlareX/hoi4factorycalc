            h2.content-subhead What is the aim of this Project?
            p
                |On this website you can find three calculators that will help you to set up your production lines in HOI4.
                p
                |The #[a(href="/divisioncalculator") Division Calculator] can be used to get the number of factories you need to produce a given amount of divisions for a given division template in a given time or it can assign your factories to a given division template in the most effective way.
                | The #[a(href="/navycalculator") Navy] and #[a(href="/aircraftcalculator") Aircraft] Calculators will return the number of factories/dockyards you need to produce a given number of ships/airplanes.
                p
                h2.content-subhead What to do if the calculators do not work correctly?
                p
                | In case you experience any errors or obviously wrong values while using the calculators, please write a mail to #[a(href="mailto:contact@hoi4factorycalculator.org") contact@hoi4factorycalculator.org] with a short description of the error and a way to reproduce it.
                |  Please take a moment before you write and check if the values you entered make sense. Trying to produce e.g. a 40-Width Tank Division in 1 day with a production efficiency of 1% will give a strange result.
